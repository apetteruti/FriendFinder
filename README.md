#FriendFinder
Need a new friend? How about one that matches your personal level of nerdiness? Take the 10-item survey based on the Nerdy Personality Attributes Scale (https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/NPAS/) to find a match.

##Description
The application takes in the users answers to the 10 questions on a 1-5 scale, adds them up, and then compares them to the nerdiness score of a list of potential friends. The application then returns the friend that has has a nerdiness score within 10 points of the user's.

The application posts the responses from the survey to api/friends after the comparison detailed above, the application then gets the results to display in a modal that appears over the survey page.
